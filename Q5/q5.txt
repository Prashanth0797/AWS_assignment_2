1. Create 2 EC2 instances.
2. Let them be source_ec2 and dest_ec2
3. Login in to source_ec2 using ssh.
4. In this machine execute this command to create new private and public key
    "ssh-keygen â€“t rsa"
5. This creates the public key id_rsa.pub, and the private key id_rsa when the destination address is given /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa
6. Got to this destination and open the public key using the command cat ida_rsa.
7. Save the public key.
8. Open the dest_ec2 and move to .ssh file and save the public key in the authorized key file.
9. Now ssh the dest_ec2 from the source_ec2.
